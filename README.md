Head of Engineering at BuzzSumo
-----------------------------------------

I like solving problems and creating stuff, and programming is just one way I scratch this itch. I have set up several mobile and web apps from scratch and helped startups turn their MVP into a full featured product now used by thousands of companies and users. I have been working remote for the past 8+ years. Mainly full-stack development, but wore many different hats throughout the years and have experience mentoring other developers and managing teams.
